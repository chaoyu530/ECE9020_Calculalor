# model 2
A simple 4-function calculator, which operates in “RPN” mode.   It has the same numbers 0-9, and the function buttons ‘+’,’-‘,’x’, ‘/’,  but instead of ‘=’ it has an ‘enter’ key. 
# model 3
A 4-function calculator, which obeys the order of operations given when multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction.  The calculator will be interactive, showing intermediate results along the way.  As a convenience to the user, bracketing keys  ‘(‘ and ‘)’ are provided.
